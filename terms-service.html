The Service may provide results that are Inaccurate or information that does not accurately reflect real events, places, people, or facts or the views or opinions of a user. The Service may use artificial intelligence to generate words, phrases, trademarks, and other literary works, sound recordings, audiovisual works, and other works of authorship (“<b>Generated Content</b>”).

                              <li><b>Eligibility.</b> You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. If you are under 18 years old but are at least 13 years old, you may use the Service with the approval and oversight of a parent or guardian. It is prohibited to use our Service if you are under 13 years old. By agreeing to these Terms, you (or, in the case of persons who under the age of 18 but are at least 13 years old, your parent or guardian) represent and warrant to Robyn that: (a) you are at least 18 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.</li>
                              <li><b>Accounts and Registration.</b> To access most features of the Service, you may have to register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, [phone number,] date of birth, or other information. After your initial account creation, Robyn may make available to you the ability to log onto the Service using a third-party service provider such as Apple or Google. If you direct Robyn to transmit data to, or receive data from, such third-party service provider on your behalf, then you authorize us to Process (defined below) your log-in credentials and all related data necessary to enable your ability to log in using such third-party service provider. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate, complete, and not misleading, and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, including the activities of any child or other end user (each, an “<b>End User</b>”) who is provided access credentials under your account. You will be liable to us for any acts or omissions of an End User that, if committed by you, would be a breach of these Terms. You may not make account access credentials available to third parties, share individual login credentials between multiple users on an account, or resell or lease access to your account or any End User account. When you register, you will be asked to create a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you should immediately notify us at <a href="mailto:hello@meetrobyn.com">hello@meetrobyn.com</a></li>
                              <li><b>General Payment Terms.</b> Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms, all fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable, except as required by law. In order to pay applicable fees, you may be asked to supply certain information, including but not limited to credit card or other payment information. You agree to pay, using a Robyn-approved payment method, all charges incurred by you or any other End User on your credit card or other payment mechanism issued to you, including, without limitation, any applicable taxes and shipping, handling, and processing charges, if any, relating to such purchases and transactions. Payment transactions may be processed by a third-party payment processor, in which case, by making a payment through the Service, you agree to be bound by and subject to such payment processor’s terms of service and privacy policy. We reserve the right to refuse to process or complete any transaction, and to cancel any transaction, in our sole discretion. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms.</li>
                              <li><b>Price.</b> Robyn reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Robyn will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date on our pricing page located at [Insert Link to Applicable Page]. We encourage you to check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information. Robyn may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Robyn gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Robyn, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Robyn’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</li>
                              <li><b>Authorization.</b> You authorize Robyn to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Robyn, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, then Robyn may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</li>
                              <li><b>Subscription Service.</b> The Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“<b>Subscription Service</b>”). The <b>“Subscription Billing Date”</b> is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select on your account (such period, the <b>“Initial Subscription Period”</b>), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a <b>“Subscription Period”</b>) unless you cancel the Subscription Service or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize Robyn or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription Service, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. Please ensure you review the Subscription Fee prior to purchasing. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription Service for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. Robyn or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with your account or that you otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription Service by logging onto the Service and following the cancellation procedure therein. <span>Your cancellation must be received before the renewal date in order to avoid charge for the next subscription period.</span></li>
                              <li><b>Delinquent Accounts.</b> Robyn may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal Subscription Fee is due, then Robyn reserves the right to delete your account and any information or Customer Content (defined below) associated with your account without any liability to you.</li>
                              <li><b>Tokens.</b> As part of the Subscription Service, you will receive a set number of tokens per month (<b>“Tokens”</b>) to process Input Content and generate and receive Output Content. These Tokens may correspond to audio Input Content, text Input Content, or other categories of Input Content that Robyn may specify from time to time. We will credit your account for any Tokens acquired by you. If you have depleted your monthly Token allotment, we may permit you to purchase additional Tokens (<b>“Purchased Tokens”</b>). Other than your Purchased Tokens, all other Tokens included in the Subscription Service expire at the end of each month of your Subscription Period. Purchased Tokens will rollover month to month.</li>
                              <li>For sake of example only, you enter into a subscription on January 1st that allocates you 25 Tokens each month. On January 31st, you have 7 Tokens left and you buy 50 Purchased Tokens. On February 1, (a) the 7 Tokens will expire, (b) the 50 Purchased Tokens will carry over, and (c) and you will be allocated 25 Tokens for the month of February, which means that you will have 75 total tokens (25 Tokens from your monthly subscription for February and 50 Purchased Tokens). If on February 28th you have 3 Tokens left from your February allocation and 20 Purchased Tokens remaining from your purchase on January 31st, then on March 1st you will have 45 tokens (25 Tokens from your monthly subscription for March and 20 remaining Purchased Tokens)</li>
                              <li>Except as otherwise provided herein or required by applicable law, your license to use any and all Tokens and Purchased Tokens will terminate upon termination of these Terms or your account. Use of most aspects of the Service require the consumption of Tokens. If you wish to use the Service but have no Token balance and do not buy Purchased Tokens, then the Service may not be fully functioning for you, or you may not have access to all portions of the Service.</li>
                              <li><b>No Cost Tokens.</b> Robyn may, at its sole discretion, provide a certain number of Tokens for you to engage with the Service at no cost. Robyn reserves the right to change the number of Tokens for such free use at any time and for any reason. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Robyn reserves the right to revoke any no-cost Tokens granted to you if Robyn, in our sole discretion, determines, or has a reasonable belief, that you have already received the specified number of no-cost Tokens using your current account or using a new account you create. For sake of clarity, you may not create multiple accounts (a) for the purpose of repeatedly taking advantage of any no-cost Tokens that Robyn may offer or (b) to otherwise avoiding payment obligations under these Terms.</li>
                              <li><b>Tokens Not Redeemable or Exchangeable.</b> Tokens and Purchased Tokens do not: (a) have an equivalent value in fiat currency; (b) act as a substitute for fiat currency; (c) act as consideration for any legally enforceable contract; or (d) earn interest. Tokens are not redeemable or exchangeable for fiat currency, monetary value, or convertible virtual currency from us or any other third party. Robyn does not have any obligation to exchange Tokens for anything of value, including, but not limited to, fiat currency, except as required by applicable law. We may place limitations on use or purchase of Tokens or Purchased Tokens. <span><b>FOR SAKE OF CLARITY, THERE ARE NO REFUNDS FOR ANY UNUSED PURCHASED TOKENS AT THE TIME OF EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS.</b></span></li>

                            <li>Robyn may offer group chat functions with certain parts of the Services, including functionality in the Service that enables communications between multiple users of the Service via text or audio chat (“Messaging”). If multiple users opt-in to participating in Messaging in a specific group as set forth in this Section 8.2 (<b>Messaging</b>), the Messaging feature allows you to send messages to those other users in that specific group (each, a “Group”). Users become members of a Group by receiving a direct invitation to join the Group by an existing Group member, or by creating the Group by inviting at least one other user (and at least one such user must accept the invitation to join). In some instances, Messaging may also allow users to send messages to users outside of a Group. In all cases if you are using Messaging, you must only do so in accordance with the requirements and restrictions set forth in these Terms, including without limitation Section 11 (Prohibited Conduct).</li>
                            <li>All text, audio, or any other information you Post in Messaging shall be considered “Input Content.” You will not submit to or via Messaging any content that is crude, damaging, dangerous, defamatory, disconcerting, discriminatory, harassing, false, harmful, illegal, inaccurate, infringing, misleading, offensive, or wrong (collectively, “Offensive Content”). Notwithstanding the foregoing prohibition on <strong>Offensive Content</strong>, you acknowledge that Robyn may, but has no obligation to, pre-screen or otherwise moderate Input Content submitted to or via Messaging, and that by using Messaging, you may be exposed to Customer Content you find qualifies as Offensive Content or that is otherwise offensive or inappropriate to you. <b>YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING MESSAGING, IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND ROBYN WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CUSTOMER CONTENT, OR ANY STATEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS, DEFAMATION, OMISSIONS, FALSEHOODS, OBSCENITY, PORNOGRAPHY, PROFANITY, OFFENSIVE CONTENT, OR OTHER TYPES OF CONTENT THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR OR ANY OTHER USERS USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING MESSAGING.</b> As between you and Robyn, you should have no expectation of privacy when using Messaging. Robyn does not control and is not liable for how other users of the Service may use the Customer Content that you submit through Messaging. Robyn does not guarantee that other users of the Service or the content that other users submit to the Service will comply with these Terms or our other terms, policies, or guidelines. You should not submit any personal or sensitive information using Messaging, including any passwords, financial information, health-related information, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, credit card information, or any other sensitive information. Customer Content submitted to or via Messaging may be viewable by Robyn and Robyn reserves the right to hide or delete messages that violate these Terms. Messaging sessions may be recorded and stored by Robyn. By using or otherwise engaging with Messaging, you authorize Robyn to record your Customer Content and to use the recordings in any manner consistent with our Privacy Policy (defined below), including to improve our Service. You may report a user to Robyn for Offensive Content or other violations of this Section 8.2 (Messaging) and, if Robyn decides to review such report and, in its sole discretion, that the reported conduct violates these Terms, Robyn may take action to enforce these Terms, including, but not limited to, terminating the offending user’s account.</li>

                            <li>You acknowledge that due to the nature of our Service and artificial intelligence generally, Output Content may not be unique and other users may receive similar content from our services. Responses that are requested by and generated for other users are not considered your Output Content, no matter how similar.

Robyn may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any Input Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms, is alleged to violate the rights of third parties, or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that, when using the Service, you will be exposed to Generated Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that Output Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Robyn with respect to Customer Content. If notified by a user or content owner that Customer Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the Customer Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, Robyn does not permit infringing activities on the Service.</li>
                            <li><b>Monitoring Content.</b> Robyn does not control and does not have any obligation to monitor: (a) Customer Content; (b) any content made available by third parties; or (c) the use of the Service by its users. You acknowledge and agree that Robyn reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Service for operational and other purposes.

                              <li><b>Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.</b> If you believe that any content made available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a written <b>“Notification of Claimed Infringement”</b> to the designated agent identified above containing the following information:</li>
                              <li>an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other right being infringed;</li>
                              <li>a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property right that you claim has been infringed;</li>

                              <li>Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by Robyn with the user alleged to have infringed a right you own or control as well as with the operators of publicly available databases that track notifications of claimed infringement, and you consent to Robyn making such disclosures. You should consult with your own lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.</li>
                              <li>Repeat Infringers. Robyn’s policy is to: (a) remove or disable access to material that Robyn believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property rights owner or authorized agent, is infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party by being made available through the Service; and (b) in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the accounts of and block access to the Service by any user who repeatedly or egregiously infringes other people’s copyright or other intellectual property rights.

                              <li>A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.</li>
                              <li><b>Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification.</b> If you submit a Counter Notification to Robyn in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then Robyn will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that Robyn will replace the removed Input Content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and Robyn will replace the removed Input Content and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Robyn’s designated agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Robyn’s system or network.</li>
                              <li><b>False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.</b> The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: “[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of Robyn relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” Robyn reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.</li>

                      <h4>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h4>
                      <div class="privacy__list--block">
                          <ul>
                              <li><b>Generally.</b> Except as described in Section 18.2 (Exceptions) and 18.3 (Opt-Out), you and Robyn agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator. <br> YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ROBYN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</li>
                              <li><b>Exceptions.</b> Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</li>
                              <li><b>Opt-Out.</b> If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Robyn AI Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 340 Fremont Street San Francisco, CA 94105 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (<b>“Opt-Out Notice”</b>). Once Robyn receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 19.2 (Governing Law). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</li>
                              <li><b>Arbitrator.</b> This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the JAMS under the rules applicable to consumer disputes (collectively, <b>“JAMS Rules”</b>) as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>, by calling the JAMS at +1-800-352-5267 or by contacting Robyn.</li>
                              <li><b>Commencing Arbitration.</b> Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (<b>“Notice of Arbitration”</b>). Robyn’s address for Notice of Arbitration is: Robyn AI Inc., 340 Fremont Street San Francisco, CA 94105. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (<b>“Demand”</b>). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Robyn may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Robyn will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000 USD or if Robyn has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the JAMS Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to JAMS. </li>
                              <li><b>Arbitration Proceedings.</b> Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your residence unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for $10,000 USD or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Robyn must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. </li>
                              <li><b>Arbitration Relief.</b> Except as provided in Section 18.8 (No Class Actions), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Robyn before an arbitrator was selected, Robyn will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) $10,000 USD. The arbitrator’s award will be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party will have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that will not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</li>
                              <li><b>No Class Actions.</b> YOU AND ROBYN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Robyn agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
                              <li><b>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</b> If Robyn makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Robyn’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Robyn will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</li>
                              <li><b>Enforceability.</b> If Section 18.8 (No Class Actions) or the entirety of this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) is found to be unenforceable, or if Robyn receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19.2 (Governing Law) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms. </li>
